  <title>Oceans</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 You call me out upon the waters
 The great unknown where feet may fail
 And there I find You in the mystery
 In oceans deep My faith will stand
[c]
 So I will call upon Your name
 And keep my eyes above the waves
 When oceans rise My soul will rest in Your embrace
 For I am Yours and You are mine
[v2]
 Your grace abounds in deepest waters
 Your sovereign hand Will be my guide
 Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
 You've never failed and You won't start now
[b]
 Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
 Let me walk upon the waters
 Wherever You would call me
 ||
 Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
 And my faith will be made stronger
 In the presence of my Savior</lyrics>
